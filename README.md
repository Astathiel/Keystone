## Project Goals 🧠

The primary goal of this project is to learn and improve my skills in:

1.  **GUI Development:** Building an interactive and intuitive user interface from scratch.
2.  **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Structuring the code in a clean, modular, and scalable way.
3.  **Data Persistence:** Saving and loading user data locally.
4.  **Application Packaging:** Turning the final JavaSript/React script into a standalone executable file.
5.  **UI/UX Design Principles:** Thinking about the user experience and creating a pleasant-looking application.

## Current Status 🚀

Currently in the **planning and design phase**. Next steps involve creating UI mockups and then beginning the initial coding of the main window and features.
